# Anomaly Detector Processor

This is a processor that takes structured data and runs anomaly detection algorithm on user configured fields in the data. The data needs to be a number(integer or real) for the anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalies. The anomaly detector processor supports the following ML algorithms to detect anomalies
 - random-cut-forest
It is recommended that the anomaly detector processor is deployed after aggregate processor in a pipeline for best results because aggregate processor aggregates events with same keys onto the same host.

## Basic Usage
To get started, create the following `pipeline.yaml`.
```yaml
ad-pipeline:
  source:
    http:
  processor:
    - anomaly_detector:
        keys: ["latency"]
        mode: 
            random_cut_forest:
  sink:
    - stdout:
```

When run, the processor will parse the messages and extracts the values for the key `latency` and pass it through RandomCutForest ML algorithm.

## Configuration

### Options

* [keys](#keys) (Required)
* [mode](#mode) (Required)

### <a name="keys"></a>
* `keys` (Required): A non-ordered `List<String>` which are used as inputs to the ML algorithm to detect anomalies in the values of the keys in the list. At least one key is required.

### <a name="mode"></a>
* `mode` (Required): The ML algorithm (or model) to use to detect anomalies. One of the existing [Modes](#anomaly-detector-modes) must be provided.
    * [random_cut_forest](#random_cut_forest)


## Available Anomaly detector modes

### <a name="random_cut_forest"></a>
* `random_cut_forest`: Processes events using Random Cut Forest ML algorithm to detect anomalies.
  * After passing a bunch of events with `latency` value between 0.2 and 0.3 are passed through the anomaly detector, when an event with `latency` value 11.5 is sent, the following anomaly event will be generated
  * More details about this can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/randomcutforest.html
        ```json
            { "latency": 11.5, "deviation_from_expected":[10.469302736820003],"grade":1.0}
        ```
        Where `deviation_from_expected` is a list of deviations for each of the keys from their corresponding expected values and `grade` is the anomaly grade indicating the severity of the anomaly

#### Options
* `shingleSize` - shingle size to be used in the ML algorithm
  * Default: `4`
  * Range: 1 - 60
* `sampleSize` - sample size size to be used in the ML algorithm
  * Default: `256`
  * Range: 100 - 2500
* `timeDecay` - time decay value to be used in the ML algorithm. Used as (timeDecay/SampleSize) in the ML algorithm
  * Default: `0.1`
  * Range: 0 - 1.0
* `type` - Type of data that is being sent to the algorithm
  * Default: `metrics`
  * Others types like `traces` will be supported in future
* `version` - version of the algorithm
  * Default: `1.0`
