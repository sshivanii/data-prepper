# Parse JSON Processor
This is a processor that takes in an Event and parses its JSON data, including any nested fields.
## Basic Usage
To get started, create the following `pipelines.yaml`.
```yaml
parse-json-pipeline:
  source:
    stdin:
  processor:
    - parse_json:
  sink:
    - stdout:
```
#### Basic Example:
If you wish to test the JSON Processor with the above config then you may find the following example useful.
Run the pipeline and paste the following line into your console, and then enter `exit` on a new line.
```
{"outer_key": {"inner_key": "inner_value"}}
```

The processor will parse the message into the following:
```
{"message": {"outer_key": {"inner_key": "inner_value"}}", "outer_key":{"inner_key":"inner_value"}}}
```
#### Example with JSON Pointer:
If you wish to parse a selection of the JSON data, you can specify a JSON Pointer using the `pointer` option in the configuration.
The following configuration file and example demonstrates a basic pointer use case.
```yaml
parse-json-pipeline:
  source:
    stdin:
  processor:
    - parse_json:
        pointer: "outer_key/inner_key"
  sink:
    - stdout:
```
Run the pipeline and paste the following line into your console, and then enter `exit` on a new line.
```
{"outer_key": {"inner_key": "inner_value"}}
```

The processor will parse the message into the following:
```
{"message": {"outer_key": {"inner_key": "inner_value"}}", "inner_key": "inner_value"}
```
## Configuration
* `source` (Optional) — The field in the `Event` that will be parsed.
    * Default: `message`

* `destination` (Optional) — The destination field of the parsed JSON. Defaults to the root of the `Event`.
    * Defaults to writing to the root of the `Event` (The processor will write to root when `destination` is `null`).
    * Cannot be `""`, `/`, or any whitespace-only `String` because these are not valid `Event` fields.

* `pointer` (Optional) — A JSON Pointer to the field to be parsed.
    * There is no `pointer` by default, meaning the entire `source` is parsed.
    * The `pointer` can access JSON Array indices as well.
    * If the JSON Pointer is invalid then the entire `source` data is parsed into the outgoing `Event`.
    * If the pointed-to key already exists in the `Event` and the `destination` is the root, then the entire path of the key will be used.
